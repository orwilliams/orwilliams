- 👋 Hi, I’m Rees Williams
- 👀 I’m interested in quasar astronomy, visualisation of astromoical data in digital plataria, large scale information systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use OpenSpace, which is a visualisation tool developed in part by NASA. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on astronomical visualisation projects, particular those using digital planetaria.
- 📫 I'm working at the University of Groningen, so look me up on www.rug.nl and you can see how to contact me.
